According to reports carried by various news services , the Brazilian government told its sugar producers that they wo n't be allowed to export sugar during the current 1989-90 season , which began May 1 , and the 1990-91 season so that it can be used to produce alcohol for automobile fuel .

Why are programs like this not eliminated ?
Program traders ' `` power to create total panic is so great that they ca n't be allowed to have their way , '' says Rep. Edward Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat .
Mrs. Gorman took advantage of low prices after the 1987 crash to buy stocks and has hunted for other bargains since the Oct. 13 plunge .

The Big Board 's directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions , but a total ban is n't being considered , Big Board officials say .
DD Acquisition Corp. , a partnership of Unicorp Canada Corp. 's Kingsbridge Capital Group and Cara Operations Ltd. , extended to Nov. 20 its $ 45-a-share offer for all Dunkin' Donuts Inc. shares outstanding .
How many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders ?
`` You 're not going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks , '' says Vanderbilt 's Prof. Stoll . ``
The offer , which was due to expire yesterday , is conditional on 50.1 % of Dunkin' common shares , on a fully diluted basis , being tendered and on the withdrawal of the company 's poison pill rights plan .
This is the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal .
`` Producers were granted the right earlier this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued '' yesterday .
Program trading is here to stay , and computers are here to stay , and we just need to understand it . ''
Short of a total ban , some anti-programmers have proposed several middle-ground reforms , which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors do n't .
DD Acquisition has launched a suit in a Delaware court seeking the withdrawal of Dunkin 's poison pill rights and employee stock ownership plans , which it claims were put in place to deter bidders .
Mr. Stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the New York State Urban Development Corp. , 1983-85 .
As a result , Ms. Ganes said , it is believed that little or no sugar from the 1989-90 crop has been shipped yet , even though the crop year is six months old .
One such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement -- or the `` good-faith '' payment of cash needed to trade them -- to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks .
Currently , margins on stock futures purchases are much lower -- roughly 7 % compared with 50 % for stocks -- making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative .
More than a half of all sugar produced in Brazil goes for alcohol production , according to Ms. Ganes .
Program trading critics also want the Federal Reserve Board , rather than the futures industry , to set such margins .
Also , there has been a switch in the past decade to planting of orange trees in areas that were previously used for cane , and this change is being felt now , she said .
Futures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active .
DD Acquisition said 2.2 million shares , or about 38.5 % of the shares outstanding , have been tendered under its offer .
Most important , Ms. Ganes noted , `` Brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet been made on the suspension of exports . ''
Higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell , they say .
The partners said they already hold 15 % of all shares outstanding .
Thomas Oxnard , sugar analyst for PaineWebber in Hackensack , N.J. , said : `` I am highly skeptical that Brazil will curtail sugar exports , particularly with the price of sugar at over 14 cents a pound . ''
Another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an `` uptick rule '' a reform instituted after the Great Crash of 1929 that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices , namely short sellers .
The Big Board 's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price .
Dunkin' has set Nov. 10 as the deadline for the receipt of any competing bids .
Above all , Mr. Oxnard noted , the situation is extremely confused .
But in 1986 , program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations , to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets .
A reinstatement of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably .
DD Acquisition said the extension is to allow this process to be completed .
`` Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation , '' he said .
Program traders argue that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the `` pricing efficiency '' of the futures and stock markets .
James A. White contributed to this article .
Dunkin' is based in Randolph , Mass .
`` It 's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out , such as the one saying exports will be suspended , and no one can confirm it . ''
Fundamentalists Jihad
Mr. Oxnard observed that the situation in Brazil is also very complicated .
Cara , a food services chain operator and Unicorp , a holding company , are based in Toronto .
On the one hand , Brazil started an ethanol program about 15 years ago to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program .
Big Board Chairman John Phelan said yesterday that he could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild stock-price swings .
Thus the band-wagon psychology of recent days picks up new impetus .
David A. DiLoreto , president of metal container division , was named to the additional post of group vice president , packaging products , at this packaging , industrial and aerospace products concern , succeeding Delmont A. Davis , who was named president and chief operating officer in August .
`` It has to weigh , on the other hand , the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol , '' Mr. Oxnard said .
Index arbitrage is a common form of program trading .
Mexico , which is normally a sugar exporter , has had production problems in the past two years , analysts said .
As usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept : Two separate markets in different locations , trading basically the same widgets , ca n't trade them for long at prices that are widely different .
Last year , it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments , they noted .
In index arbitrage , the widget is the S&P 500 , and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in Chicago and the stock markets largely in New York .
This year it is expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about 200,000 tons of sugar to meet internal needs , analysts said .
In other commodity markets yesterday :
ENERGY :
To profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity , someone who owns the S&P 500 widget in New York must sell it and replace it with a cheaper S&P 500 widget in Chicago .
Petroleum futures were generally higher with heating oil leading the way .
On the New York Mercantile Exchange , heating oil for December delivery increased 1.25 cents to settle at 60.36 cents a gallon .
If the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the S&P 500 index , he is likely to remain fully invested at all times .
Gasoline futures were mixed to unchanged .
( Few , if any , index-fund managers will risk leveraging performance by owning more than 100 % exposure to stocks , and equally few will want to own less than a 100 % position should stocks rise . )
But the strength in heating oil helped push up crude oil .
By constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget , index-arbitrage traders hope to add between 1 % and 3 % to the annual return of the S&P 500 .
West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose 13 cents a barrel to settle at $ 20.07 .
That represents a very thin `` excess '' return , certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective .
The firmness in heating oil was attributed to colder weather in parts of the U.S. and to the latest weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute , which showed a decline in inventories of the fuel .
The fact that a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers fail to beat the S&P 500 may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue .
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS :
As more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy , these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and , eventually , eliminated .
Prices closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices to come .
The current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the S&P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market .
Trading was muted in part because of the observance of All Saints ' Day across much of Europe .
Continued export demand also supported prices .
The New York Stock Exchange 's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors ' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares .
So if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget , how did `` program trading '' evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers ?
As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the U.S. , market analysts said that late Tuesday the Chinese government , which often buys U.S. grains in quantity , turned instead to Britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat .
All arguments against program trading , even those pressed without fact , conclude with three expected results after `` reforms '' are implemented : 1 ) reduced volatility , 2 ) a long-term investment focus , and 3 ) a level playing field for the small investor .
Traders said prices also were supported by widespread rumors that the Soviet Union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the U.S. .
That designation would , among other things , provide more generous credit terms under which the Soviets could purchase grain .
The Soviets are widely believed to need additional supplies , despite running up record one-month purchases of 310 million bushels of corn in October .
COPPER :
But many of these reforms are unneeded , even harmful .
FALL BALLOT ISSUES set a record for off-year elections .
Futures prices rose , extending Tuesday 's gains .
Reducing volatility .
An index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in New York and Chicago to cover all transaction costs .
Odd-year elections attract relatively few ballot issues .
The December contract advanced 2.50 cents a pound to $ 1.1650 .
Arbitrage does n't cause volatility ; it responds to it .
But the 1989 fall total of 80 , while well below 1988 activity , shows `` a steady ratcheting up in citizen referenda and initiatives , '' says Patrick McGuigan , editor of Family , Law and Democracy Report .
Buying for the most part carried over from the previous session , and traders apparently ignored reports that a Chilean mine strike may have ended almost before it began , an analyst said .
Think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for S&P 500 stocks -- usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in Chicago .

According to news service reports , most workers at the Disputado mines owned by Exxon Corp. agreed to a new two-year wage contract that includes a 5 % increase and other benefits .
A large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures .
However , some workers have n't yet accepted the new contract and are continuing negotiations , the analyst said .
Arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from Chicago to New York , while functioning as a buyer in Chicago .

Separately , Reuter reported that the Papua-New Guinea government urged its Parliament to extend a state of emergency in copper-rich Bougainville Island for two months .
The start of the whole process is the key - someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets to make widget prices move .
Why does this large hypothetical seller trade in Chicago instead of New York ?
In California , two petition drives for next year 's election are `` essentially finished , '' says David Schmidt , author of `` Citizen Lawmakers . ''
The Bougainville copper mine has been inoperative since May 15 because of attacks by native landowners who want Bougainville to secede from Papua-New Guinea .

If not Chicago , then in New York ; if not the U.S. , then overseas .
Taking a cue from California , more politicians will launch their campaigns by backing initiatives , says David Magleby of Brigham Young University .
Volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage , but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity .

Encouraging long-term investing .
In part , prices reflect development of a market structure based on such variables as the number of prints .
We must be very cautious about labeling investors as `` long-term '' or `` short-term . ''
This information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal , says Beth Gates-Warren of Sotheby 's .
Policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are akin to placing a sign over the Big Board 's door saying : `` Buyers welcome , sellers please go away ! ''
`` There is finally some sort of sense in the market , '' she says .
The ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive , and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term .
Corporations and museums are among the serious buyers , giving greater market stability , says Robert Persky of the Photograph Collector .
A free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can tolerate .
`` When I see prints going into the hands of institutions , I know they are n't going to come back on the market . ''
In point of fact , volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today .

Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile , usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change ( 1973-75 , 1937-40 , and 1928-33 for example ) .
But much contemporary work is also fetching `` a great deal of money , '' says Miles Barth of the International Center of Photography .
It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream `` foul '' on program trading when the markets decline , while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise .
DIALING 900 brings callers a growing number of services .
Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks , instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins ?
Currently a $ 300 million-a-year business , 900 telephone service is expected to hit $ 500 million next year and near $ 2 billion by 1992 as uses for the service continue to expand , says Joel Gross of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Inc .
Some of the proposed fixes for what is labeled `` program-trading volatility '' could be far worse than the perceived problem .
The service -- which costs the caller from 30 cents to $ 25 a minute -- currently is dominated by celebrity chatter , horoscopes and romance lines .
In using program trading as a whipping boy , fundamentalist investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing stock-selection products .
But more serious applications are in the wings , and that is where the future growth is expected .
They may , however , risk bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets themselves .
`` I 'm starting to see more business transactions , '' says Andrea West of American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , noting growing interest in use of 900 service for stock sales , software tutorials and even service contracts .

DIAPER SERVICES make a comeback amid growing environmental concerns .

Among its new customers : day-care centers that previously spurned the service .
Left to its own devices , index arbitrage will become more and more efficient , making it harder and harder to do profitably .
The National Association of Diaper Services , Philadelphia , says that since January it has gotten more than 672 inquiries from people interested in starting diaper services .
Spreads will become so tight that it wo n't matter which market an investor chooses -- arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit .
Elisa Hollis launched a diaper service last year because State College , Pa. , where she lives , did n't have one .
If government or private watchdogs insist , however , on introducing greater friction between the markets ( limits on price moves , two-tiered execution , higher margin requirements , taxation , etc. ) , the end loser will be the markets themselves .

BRIEFS :
The parent of Younkers , after failing to find a buyer for the chain of Midwestern department stores , said it will sell a stake in the chain to management and take other steps to reduce its investment in retailing .
Only 57.6 % of New Yorkers watch the local news , the lowest viewership in the country , says a new study by Impact Resources Inc. , Columbus , Ohio ... .
Equitable of Iowa Cos. , Des Moines , had been seeking a buyer for the 36-store Younkers chain since June , when it announced its intention to free up capital to expand its insurance business .
FreudToy , a pillow bearing the likeness of Sigmund Freud , is marketed as a $ 24.95 tool for do-it-yourself analysis .
But Equitable said it was unable to find a buyer willing to pay what it considers `` fair value '' for Younkers because of recent turmoil in the bond and stock markets and in retailing .
Reuters Holdings PLC said Michael Reupke resigned as general manager to pursue unspecified interests , a move the news organization termed an `` amicable separation . ''
Younkers rang up sales in 1988 of $ 313 million .
Mr. Reupke , 52 years old and a 27-year Reuters veteran , had been the information-services company 's general manager for only six months .
It operates stores mostly in Iowa and Nebraska .
His appointment to that post , which has senior administrative , staff and policy responsibilities , followed a several-year tenure as Reuters 's editor in chief .
Younkers management is likely to buy a 10 % to 20 % interest in the chain in January , said Fred S. Hubbell , Equitable 's president and chief executive officer .
No successor was named , and Mr. Reupke 's duties will be split among three other senior Reuters executives , the company said .
He said Equitable hopes to eventually reduce its stake in Younkers to less than 50 % .
In a telephone interview , Mr. Reupke said his departure was for `` personal reasons , '' which he declined to specify .
USX Corp. posted a 23 % drop in third-quarter profit , as improved oil results failed to offset weakness in steel and natural gas operations .
`` There is no business reason for my departure , '' nor any disagreement over policy , he added .
The nation 's largest steelmaker earned $ 175 million , or 62 cents a share , compared with the year-earlier $ 228 million , or 80 cents a share .
He also rejected reports that his departure stemmed from disappointment the general manager 's post had n't also led to a board directorship at the London-based news organization .
The recent quarter includes pretax gains of $ 98 million from asset sales , while like gains in the year-earlier quarter totaled $ 61 million .
Mr. Reupke was one of three executives on Reuters 's eight-person executive committee who did n't also serve on the company 's board of directors .
In the 1988 period , USX also had a $ 71 million after-tax gain from a tax dispute settlement .
`` If I were choosing the people of tomorrow , I would have chosen the people who are now on the board , '' he said .
Sales rose 5 % to $ 4.4 billion from $ 4.2 billion .
A Reuters spokesman said the departure reflects `` no change in strategy or profits . ''
The earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last year 's unusually strong third quarter , when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing .
Mark Shepperd , an analyst at UBS Phillips & Drew in London , said , `` I suspect ( the departure ) will be fairly irrelevant for the company .
However , third-quarter operating profit fell 14 % , as USX sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments , eliminating income from those operations .
I would be very surprised if his departure signals any change in strategy or change in profit expectations . ''
Among segments that continue to operate , though , the company 's steel division continued to suffer from soft demand for its tubular goods serving the oil industry and other markets .
On London 's Stock Exchange , Reuters shares rose five pence to 913 pence ( $ 14.43 ) .
Peter Marcus , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. , said that a downturn in the appliance industry , coupled with sluggish automotive sales , hurt USX results .
In the U.S. over-the-counter market , American depositary shares for Reuters , each representing three shares in the London market , closed unchanged at $ 43.875 .
Moreover , USX exports more than other steelmakers , and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure .
The senior of the three executives who will assume Mr. Reupke 's duties is Nigel Judah , 58 , finance director and a Reuters board director .
The company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the Lorain , Ohio , plant , which now is a 50-50 joint venture with Japan 's Kobe Steel Ltd .
Peter Holland , 45 , deputy general manager , becomes director of corporate affairs .
In the steel division , operating profit dropped 11 % to $ 85 million .
And Patrick Mannix , 46 , international technical manager , becomes director of group quality programs .
Profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $ 33 a ton from $ 42 a ton last year and $ 53 a ton in the second quarter , analysts said .
Leon J. Level , vice president and chief financial officer of this computer services concern , and F. Warren McFarlan , a professor at Harvard University 's Graduate School of Business , were elected directors , increasing board membership to nine .
Still , USX fared better than other major steelmakers , earning more per ton of steel shipped than either Bethlehem Steel Corp. , which posted a 54 % drop in net income , or Inland Steel Industries Inc. , whose profit plummeted 70 % .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , USX shares closed up $ 1.25 , at $ 34.625 , as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who had n't expected as great a volume of asset sales .
The rise in the stock 's price may also reflect the fact that USX 's steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers ' .
Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , said USX may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year .
He said USX also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products , such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet , than lower-priced structural goods .
The energy segment , with a 15 % rise in operating profit , is clearly the company 's strongest .
Higher crude oil prices helped boost operating profit for the Marathon Oil Co. unit to $ 198 million from $ 180 million .
The Texas Oil & Gas division continues to operate in the red , although losses narrowed to $ 9 million from $ 15 million .
USX announced in October that it was soliciting bids to sell TXO 's oil and gas reserves .
Proceeds of that sale are to be used to reduce debt and buy back shares .
The company noted that it has reduced debt by $ 1.6 billion since the end of 1988 and bought back about 15.5 million shares of common stock since the fourth quarter of 1987 .
USX has about $ 5.5 billion in long-term debt and 257 million shares outstanding .
The announced sale of the reserves was followed by news that investor Carl Icahn had increased his stake in USX to 13.1 % and threatened a takeover or other business combination .
Mr. Icahn has said he believes USX would be worth more if broken up into steel and energy segments .
Profit for the nine months jumped 21 % to $ 721 million , or $ 2.62 a share , from $ 598 million , or $ 2.07 a share .
Sales rose 10 % to $ 13.8 billion from $ 12.5 billion .
